Song : Clouds 
Artist: Rocco
Release year: 2021
I fell in love
There's no stopping now
See my head's in the clouds
And I'm not coming down for a while
So keep me company
Can't get enough of me
Happened so suddenly
There's nothing underneath
I fell in love
There's no stopping now
See my head's in the clouds
And I'm not coming down for a while
So keep me company
Can't get enough of me
Happened so suddenly
There's nothing underneath
I get
Caught in my fantasies in my fantasies
Yeah my head's in the clouds
There's nothing under me
Nothing under me yeah yeah
I fell in love
There's no stopping now
See my head's in the clouds
And I'm not coming down for a while
So keep me company
Can't get enough of me
Happened so suddenly
There's nothing underneath
I fell in love
There's no stopping now
See my head's in the clouds
And I'm not coming down for a while
So keep me company
Can't get enough of me
Happened so suddenly
There's nothing underneath
